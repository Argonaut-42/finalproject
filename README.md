# finalproject
Description of the project: Here you must create a page, with a single "refresh" button. The click of the button will initiate the retrieval of data from your API and the rendering of at least one chart. Students should include some additional descriptive text on the page so that it is clear to the instructor (or any other reader) what the purpose of their chart is.

Student work will be evaluated by the instructor based on the following criteria.
A. Functionality – Does the application work? Does it reflect an understanding JavaScript and APIs? Does the chart data change over time?
B. Utility – Your chart(s) should "tell a story". Your visualization work should stand on its own and not rely heavily on lengthy written explanation.
C. Accuracy – You must not misrepresent the underlying data. Mistakes to avoid: calculation errors, choosing an inappropriate chart type, omitting important data values, or including the same data values more than once.
D. Visual Appeal - Simple solutions are acceptable … this is not an artistic design class! But the HTML portion of your work should demonstrate attention to detail and thoughtfulness. Similarly, the chart(s) you create should minimize graphical complexity and avoid "chart junk".
E. Originality – Students are expected to do more than merely mimic the work of their peers. If you are doing your own work, analyzing your own API data source, and creating your own chart(s) then you can expect full marks for originality. If you are not doing those things, you may lose points in this category or – far worse – violate the academic integrity of the course. Consult the syllabus for the consequences of academic integrity violations.
